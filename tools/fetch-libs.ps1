# The publicized assemblies are NOT necessarily under the game folder.
#
# Learned 2026-09-10, the day Valheim shipped 1.0.7: a game update does NOT regenerate the
# in-game publicized_assemblies folder. It still held 0.2x files from July, so copying from
# it would have quietly rebuilt every mod against the OLD API - a clean build, and a mod that
# dies at runtime. The owner publicizes into a working folder instead.
#
# AMENDED 2026-09-11, after this script shipped a stale file anyway. Choosing a FOLDER by the
# date of one file inside it is the bug: the in-game folder's assembly_valheim_publicized.dll
# was ONE MINUTE newer than the Desktop one, so the in-game folder won outright - and dragged
# along its assembly_utils_publicized.dll, still from July, two months older than the game's
# own assembly_utils.dll. All six repos ended up with it. Vector2s happens to exist in both
# copies, which is the only reason nothing broke.
#
# So the unit of choice is a FILE, not a folder. Take the newest copy of each name across every
# candidate, and apply the staleness guard to each file against ITS OWN game assembly.
